# VFDWatchFace
A WearOS watch face mimicking digital display also sporting numerous complication slots

Goals:

* The time display section somewhat mimics pixellated digital display.
* Besides that I'm placing several slots around for complications.
* The complications may or may not have the pixellated look.
* A main goal is to preserve battery also decrease installation size, so there's no background image. But the style contains a font.
* Many complication slots provides the user high configurability.
