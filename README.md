Goals:

* The time display section somewhat mimics pixelated digital display / VFD.
* The face offers two rows of complication slots, three slots each in a row above and below the time section.
* The complications also pick up the pixelated look and the color scheme wherever possible.
* A main goal is to preserve battery also decrease installation size, so there's no background image. The resources are vectorial. The watch face embeds a font (VT323) which provides the pixelated look though.
* The abundance of complication slots provides high configurability.
